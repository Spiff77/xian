# Java Compilation and Execution

This directory contains a simple Java program that demonstrates the compilation and execution process.

## Files

- `HelloWorld.java` - The source code file containing the Java program
- `HelloWorld.class` - The compiled bytecode file generated by the Java compiler

## The `javac` Command

The `javac` command is the Java compiler that transforms human-readable Java source code into bytecode that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

When you run:
```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
```

The compiler:
1. Reads the source code from `HelloWorld.java`
2. Parses and validates the syntax
3. Compiles it into bytecode
4. Generates `HelloWorld.class` containing the bytecode

## Why Both Files Exist

- **HelloWorld.java** - The original source code that humans write and read
- **HelloWorld.class** - The compiled bytecode that the JVM can execute

The `.class` file contains platform-independent bytecode that can run on any system with a JVM installed. This is why Java is considered "write once, run anywhere."

## Running the Program

To execute the compiled program:
```bash
java HelloWorld
```

Note: You run `java` with the class name (without the `.class` extension), not the filename.
