Important things to remember:
- You need to have the backend in JavaScript (as we learn in the course). The Frontend is in HTML and JavaScript. Use MySQL for the database. You need to do at least one external API call.
- The Backend should be available as an API.
- Do not use the HSBC name or Logo anywhere in the project.
- Each table is working together as a team.
- Presentation day will be at the end of the course, exact date and time still needs to be defined.
- Your manager will check your GitHub and your Jira. They expect participation of everybody of the team.
- Make the frontend look beautiful!
- Add a README file to your git project.
