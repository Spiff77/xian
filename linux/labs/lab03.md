# Lab 3 - cat / tail / head

## File Content:

1. Using `man cat` , find a way to display the line number of the file `/etc/passwd`
2. Show the first 5 lines of `/etc/passwd`?
3. Show the last 3 lines of `/etc/passwd`?
4. Search online how to skip the first 3 lines and show the rest of the file and display the content of`/etc/passwd` from line 4 to the end of the file /etc/passwd.

## File Manipulation:

1. Create empty files: `contact.html`, `style.css,`and create folders: `backend`, `frontend`
2. Copy a file named `contact.html` to `index.html`.
3. Move `index.html` and `style.css` to the directory named `frontend`.
4. Remove the file named `contact.html`.
5. Now your `frontend` folder should contains 2 files
6. Try to remove the directory named `frontend` with rmdir and explain why it does or doesn't work.
Remove `frontend` including its contents using the right command.
